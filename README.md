# File Templates


*Fasten your workflow and get rid of the numbing boilerplate typing*

File Templates package allows you to create any number of templates to use in creating new files. 

### Template files

Templates are just ordinary files, with some additional metadata saved into the dedicated IDB. 
This approach allows a transparent inspection of files. You may for example allow all files in a certain directory to
be uzed as templates by simply copying or moving them into the File Templates' template directory.
